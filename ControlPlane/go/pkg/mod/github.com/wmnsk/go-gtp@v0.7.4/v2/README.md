# v2: GTPv2 in Golang

Package v2 provides the simple and painless handling of GTPv2-C protocol in pure Golang.

## Getting Started

_Working examples are available in [example](../examples) directory, which might be the better instruction for developers._

### Opening a connection

#### Client

`Dial` opens a connection between the specified peer by confirming the peer is alive by Echo Request/Response exchange. If you don't need Echo, see Server section.

```go
// Note that the conn is not bound to raddr. to let a Conn to be able to communicate with multiple peers.
// Interface type is required here to let Conn know which is the local interface type.
conn, err := v2.Dial(ctx, laddr, raddr, v2.IFTypeS11MMEGTPC, 0)
if err != nil {
    // ...
}
```

#### Server 

Retrieve `Conn` with `NewConn`, and `ListenAndServe` to start listening.

```go
// Interface type is required here to let Conn know which is the local interface type.
srvConn := v2.NewConn(srvAddr, v2.IFTypeS11MMEGTPC, 0)
if err := srvConn.ListenAndServe(ctx); err != nil {
    // ...
}
```

### Handling incoming messages

Prepare functions that comform to [`HandlerFunc`](https://godoc.org/github.com/wmnsk/go-gtp/v2#Conn.AddHandler), and register them to `Conn` with `AddHandler`. This should be done as soon as you get `Conn` not to miss the incoming messages.

`HandlerFunc` is to handle the incoming messages by message type. See [example](../examples) for how it is like.  
Also consider using `AddHandlers` when you have many `HandlerFunc`s.

```go
// write what you expect to do on receiving a message. Handlers should be added per message type.
// by default, Echo Request/Response and Version Not Supported Indication is handled automatically.
conn.AddHandler(
    // first param is the type of message. give number in uint8 or use v2.MsgTypeXXX.
    messages.MsgTypeCreateSessionResponse,
    // second param is the HandlerFunc to describe how you handle the message coming from peer.
    func(c *v2.Conn, senderAddr net.Addr, msg messages.Message) error {
        // Do what you want with CreateSessionResponse message here.
        // see examples directly for functional examples
    },
)
```

### Manipulating sessions

With `Conn`, you can create, modify, delete GTPv2-C sessions and bearers with the built-in methods.

#### Session creation

`CreateSession` creates a Session, while storing values given as IEs and creating a default bearer.
In the following call, for example, IMSI and TEID for S1-U eNB is stored in the created `Session`.

```go
session, err := c.CreateSession(
    // put IEs required for your implementation here.
    // it is easier to use constructors in ies package.
    ies.NewIMSI("123451234567890"),
    
    // or, you can use ies.New() to create an IE without type-specific constructor.
    // put the type of IE, flags/instance, and payload as the parameters.
    ies.New(ies.ExtendedTraceInformation, 0x00, []byte{0xde, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xef}),
    
    // to set the instance to IE created with message-specific constructor, WithInstance()
    // may be your help.
    ies.NewIMSI("123451234567890").WithInstance(1), // no one wants to set instance to IMSI, though.

    // don't forget to contain the Sender F-TEID, as it is used to distinguish the incoming
    // messages by Conn.
    //
    // to be secure, TEID should be generated with random values, without conflicts in a Conn.
    // to achieve that, v2 provides NewFTEID() which returns F-TEID in *ies.IE.
    s11Conn.NewFTEID(v2.IFTypeS11MMEGTPC, mmeIP, ""),
)
if err != nil {
    // ...
}
```

#### Session deletion / Bearer modification

`DeleteSession` and `ModifyBearer` methods are provided to send each message as easy as possible.
Unlike `CreateSession`, they don't manipulate the Session information automatically.

### Opening a U-Plane connection

_See [v1/README.md](../v1/README.md#opening-a-u-plane-connection)._

## Supported Features

The following Messages marked with "Yes" are currently available with their own useful constructors.

_Even there are some missing Messages, you can create any kind of Message by using `messages.NewGeneric()`._
