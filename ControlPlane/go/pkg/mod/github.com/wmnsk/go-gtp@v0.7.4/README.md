# go-gtp: GTP in Golang

Package gtp provides simple and painless handling of GTP(GPRS Tunneling Protocol), implemented in the Go Programming Language.

## Features

* Flexible enough to **control everything in GTP protocol**.;
  * For developing mobile core network nodes (see [examples](./examples)).
  * For developing testing tools like traffic simulators or fuzzers.
* Many **helpers kind to developers** provided, like session, bearer, and TEID associations.
* Easy handling of **multiple connections with fixed IP and Port** with UDP (or other `net.PacketConn`).
* ~~No platform-specific codes inside, so it **works almost everywhere Golang works**.~~ _Currently it works only on Linux and macOS since netlink support is introduced. I'll make them separated from the base to let it work even on Windows in the future._

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The following packages should be installed before starting.  

```shell-session
go get -u github.com/pkg/errors
go get -u github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp
go get -u github.com/pascaldekloe/goe/verify
```

If you use Go 1.11+, you can also use Go Modules.

```shell-session
GO111MODULE=on go [test | build | run | etc...]
```

### Running examples

Examples works as it is by `go build` and executing commands in the following way.

1. Open four terminals on a machine and start capturing on loopback interface.

2. Start P-GW on terminal #1 and #2
```shell-session
// on terminal #1
./pgw

// on terminal #2
./pgw -s5c 127.0.0.53 -s5u 127.0.0.5
```

3. Start S-GW on terminal #3

```shell-session
// on terminal #3
./sgw
```

4. Start MME on terminal #4

```shell-session
// on terminal #4
./mme
```

5. You will see the nodes exchanging Create Session and Modify Bearer on C-Plane, and ICMP Echo on U-Plane afterwards.

_If you want to see fewer number of subscribers, please comment-out the `v2.Subscriber` definitions in `example/mme/main.go`._

### Developing by your own

Each version has `net.PacketConn`-like APIs and GTP-specific ones which is often version-specific.
The basic idea behind the current implementation is;

* `Dial` or `ListenAndServe` to create a connection(`Conn`) between nodes.
* Register handlers to the `Conn` for specific messages with `AddHandler`, which allows users to handle the messages coming from the remote endpoint as flexible as possible, with less pain.
* `CreateXXX` to create session or PDP context with arbitrary IEs given. Session/PDP context is structured and they also have some helpers like `AddTEID` to handle known TEID properly.

For the detailed usage of specific version, see README.md under each version's directory.

| Version | Details                   |
|---------|---------------------------|
| GTPv0   | [README.md](v0/README.md) |
| GTPv1   | [README.md](v1/README.md) |
| GTPv2   | [README.md](v2/README.md) |

## Supported Features

Note that "supported" means that the package provides helpers which makes it easier to handle.
In other words, even if a message/IE is not marked as "Yes", you can make it work with some additional effort.

Your contribution is welcome to implement helpers for all the types, of course!

## Disclaimer

This is still an experimental project. Any part of implementations(including exported APIs) may be changed before released as v1.0.0.
